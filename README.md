Our game's primary goal is to help players understand how their choices today will affect the world of tomorrow. Making the wrong decisions now will have a negative impact on our future and make it challenging for people to survive on Earth.

## Implementation:

The first level depicts an undeveloped world, evoking prehistoric times. By overcoming challenges and gathering game goods, the player progresses through the game.

He will occasionally be required to make choices that will determine the situation of the following level. The player can respond to these queries while he is roaming the globe by selecting one of the dialogue boxes that will display them.

This universe primarily consists of mountains and plants, with no signs of human-made objects.

The world and a village representing the evolution during the ancient era are depicted on the second level. The actions made in the previous level will affect some of the village's characteristics. The player must go through this level to gather the items while avoiding hazards. A settlement can be found in the game's setting, which can also include the desert, depending on the choices made at earlier levels.

This game's third and final level features a metropolis that shows how society has changed in the modern era. The selections made in the previous level will affect some of the city's attributes as well. To collect the goods, the player can move about the level.
